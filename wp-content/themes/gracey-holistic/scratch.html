I want to make 3 points about my treatment with acupuncturist Robert Gracey.

• He provided prompt and sustained relief of my acute shoulder pain.
• As an MD with 4 Board Certifications, it was amazing to experience these results.
• He took an active and useful interest in my overall lifestyle, particularly nutrition.

It is my pleasure to recommend him to you.

Robert Gracey has been a lifesaver for me. At first my expectations were low, because I was feeling so poorly, mentally and physically (due to overwork and poor diet) and was unfamiliar with his mode of Japanese acupuncture but one session sufficed for me to become a complete convert: I literally felt lighter on my feet after just one treatment, as if a huge burden had lifted from both body and mind. It was the beginning of a slow, but steady return to health.

An acupuncturist of rare expertise Robert Gracey is also, simply, a wonderful human being of uncommon empathy, gentleness, and sensitivity to the needs of his clients. One of the few certified masters in his profession in the US, he, is equally as proficient and wise in all other aspects of the pursuit of health, bodily or mental, especially nutrition and metaphysics.

As client or patient, I have interacted with many health practitioners, traditional and "alternative," and Robert Gracey is simply one of the very best, by any reckoning.

I received treatments from Robert Gracey during a very difficult life passage which held a lot of loss and disillusionment for me. The sensitive fine tuning of insertion-less acupuncture lifted my spirit with an immediate response which amazed me. I continually felt lighter and more buoyant with each treatment and less isolated.

His suggestions of hip stretches to release long held tensions were spot on and I found great value in his nutritional suggestions, when I remembered to follow them! His knowledge base is broad and thorough and he is able to pinpoint what will assist one toward optimal healing for whatever it is one is working through.

Robert Gracey’s skilled and attentive care was a game changer in my life. Six years ago my husband was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Caring for him, our two young children and fearing what lay ahead had put a tremendous strain on the health of my body, mind and spirit. I feel as though I found Robert at the perfect time!

As my husband became increasingly sicker our fear and stress increased. After just one treatment I felt a powerful release of anxiety and struggle. Peace moved in and I was able to accept more gracefully what was to come and to see that there was in fact another way to experience even the most painful events of life. I continued treatment and my husband soon followed until his life came to a close.

I feel profound gratitude for how Robert treated both of us as we moved through this most intense phase of our lives together. When my husband became bedridden, Robert came to our home twice a week to treat him. Near the end of my husband’s life, he stopped using pain medication, so instead of high levels of narcotics clouding his experience, he was able to die awake in mind and heart. This was a gift beyond measure.

Robert gracefully became part of our very intimate process, becoming a beacon of light as we moved through a tremendous sea of change and release. I highly recommend his compassionate, individually nuanced care for anyone going through a difficult crisis of the body, mind or spirit. By gently opening his patients up to receive light and love his treatments have the capacity to change the course of lives.

I saw Mr. Gracey in the throes of serious orthopedic pain and side effects from a variety of medications I was taking at the time of hip replacement. I received expert multi-systemic, holistic assessment including nutritional, physical-medical, and orthopedic.

The plan we developed and the acupuncture that followed was sensitive and cooperative and expertly applied. In a matter of a month, I had significant changes that helped both body and mind. I have fully returned to pre-arthritic and pre-joint replacement levels of activity and all systems are firing better than ever.

I strongly recommend Mr. Gracey for acupuncture and holistic treatment.

I first came to see Robert three years ago. I was having daily stomach pain, mixed with other mental and emotional imbalances. I had been to acupuncture a couple times before, but never for repeated treatment.

After about four weeks, I started to be able to tune into the energies in my body and the treatment more and more. Since then it has only deepened. Each acupuncture treatment slows down my body, and in a way presses a reset button. Of course, the treatment (which soon became one of the highlights of my week) is not the sole fix-all. If you're looking for a fix all, let me know because I've been looking for years and haven't found it.

Robert works well with helping you re-create yourself outside the treatment so that he is a check in point, a guide to moving yourself toward balance. I feel that now I am past where the treatment brought me when I first came in. I can now better manage stress even at times when it would have been more difficult before seeing Robert. Stomach pain comes only sometimes and I am able to notice when it is coming, why it is coming and how to stop and heal it before it gets worse. This is because through his treatment, I have become a friend in communication with my body-feeling in a way I was blind to before.

I would encourage anyone looking to heal or thinks that the mind-body connection plays into healing or wants to work on becoming more balanced to see Robert. Even if there is nothing medically to heal, I believe his treatment can lead to a more fulfilling life, because it has for me. After a short time, you will notice that his personal approach is very healing and it can become a place you look forward to going.

For most of my adult life I have struggled with Alopecia Areata, an auto-immune disease that causes hair loss and is often triggered by my own stress. Since the age of 14 I endured monthly steroid injections in my scalp as a treatment which worked at growing the hair back, but never stopped the actual hair loss itself. It was a vicious cycle of hair loss and regrowth. At 32, after almost two decades of steroid use, the treatment stopped working and nothing was growing back anymore.

I am so thankful that I found Robert. He is unique in that his goal is to find the cause of your ailment and fix it rather than just treating what’s on the surface. Since commencing treatments with him I have not only seen regrowth, but I haven’t had hair loss in months. On top of that, I actually feel better; I pay attention to what my body is telling me, manage my stress, and take better care of myself overall due to Robert’s coaching and recommendations. He is knowledgeable and wise and—unlike many medical professionals I’ve come across—he actually listens to me.

I cannot recommend him enough. Go see him!

I have been a client of Robert Gracey’s for almost 12 years.  Robert has helped me with an array of issues including a strained psoas muscle, asthma, allergies, stress and total balance of mind and body.

Robert has a vast variety of skills and techniques that have helped me tremendously.  I appreciate his extensive knowledge of the muscle and skeletal structure of the body.  His skills and knowledge have prevented me from potential surgery and the need to take medication.

The stress relief benefit makes it much easier to focus on the big picture and ultimately lead to more success.

Also, I have had both of my daughters treated by Robert for anxiety, which yielded positive results as well.

I came to Robert both curious and nervous about the non-insertive style of acupuncture. (I'd had two prior experiences with acupuncture that brought out too much too fast, and left me feeling worse.) But Robert gently allayed my fears and taught me there was another way to benefit from this style of healing.

Before each and every session, Robert not always listened to my health concerns, but heard me when I shared what was happening in my life. I believe that learning more about me and the stresses I faced in my relationship and in my career helped him create an experience in the treatment room that always left me feeling more grounded, calm, and centered.

He also (amazingly) eliminated any cramping from my monthly cycle!

I highly recommend Robert as a practitioner--he has a kind, caring soul that has the power to heal beyond the services he provides.

I came in to see Robert after I had been rear ended in a car accident. I had pain all over, especially in my left knee. He not only treated me for pain, but treated me for the bodily held trauma that resulted from the accident.

Robert used a combination of moxa and a non-insertive needling technique.  He was extremely supportive with lifestyle and nutrition counselling. I was going on an extended trip while being treated, and he applied Kinesio tape to my knee for extra support while on vacation, and taught me additional things to do to help me have the best time I possibly could.

I highly recommend Robert as a knowledgeable and deeply caring practitioner.

As the result of a fall, I had a compression fracture of one of the vertebrae of my lower back. I went to see Robert after a required initial resting and healing period. I was just beginning to do physical therapy and I was still experiencing a great deal of nerve pain going down my left leg, ankle swelling, pain in my pelvic area, and general lack of vitality.

Robert’s treatments with both insertion and non-insertion acupuncture, as well as his use of essential oils, helped to quiet my system so that I could do the movement and exercise I needed to further heal and get back into shape. I also regained the energy required to engage in activities without the concern that I would get stranded somewhere. Robert provided great support for my exercise routine and nutritional information that also promoted greater wellbeing.

Robert’s treatments were very effective during the acute phase of my healing and, now I’m able to progress further in wellness with periodic tune-up sessions. I know that his work contributed to helping me feel better than I did before my accident.

Based on the number of modalities that he employs and his willingness to be part of a therapeutic team, I know that I can recommend Robert as a good healer for a variety of health issues.

Renee Shapiro, Retired Research Scientist

Over the course of many years I have had acupuncture treatment with Robert for a wide variety of athletic injuries. His attention to detail, his approach to diagnosis and specific treatment has been invaluable.

The non-invasive technique he employs is especially relaxing and soothing. The benefits I've derived have been short of miraculous and I continue to participate in all the outdoor sports that I love.

As a health care practitioner myself I have referred many patients to Robert and the feedback I get has been as positive as my own experience.

I met Robert through a former client many years ago but it wasn't until very recently that I had availed myself of his services. Between the pain in my arthritic knees and lower back pain, I couldn't wait to put myself in his hands...quite literally.

His skills in non-insertive acupuncture, holistic health consultation and his willingness to truly listen and get to the root cause of my problems make him an exception practitioner. I'm happy to say I'm now living pain-free and feeling grateful for my time with Robert.

When Robert and I first became acquainted, it was very natural and our energies gravitated toward each other. Becoming a client of his acupuncture practice felt as though it was supposed to happen. During our sessions, I was very open to what acupuncture could to do.

By being open and comfortable, this aided the process of my spiritual journey. In between sessions I noticed an increase in my happiness, self-awareness, and an overall sense of a positive future ahead and an acceptance of who and where I am in life.

Robert continues to help me align my energies and provide great resources for dietary/digestive health.

I would recommend Robert Gracey to any of my friends who are looking to feel better physically but also attempting to move forward in their own spiritual journey!
